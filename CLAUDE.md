# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

WAVE SPACE is a comprehensive community platform for real estate sales professionals in Korea. It combines information sharing, career development, and gamification elements to create an engaging ecosystem for industry practitioners.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE

**DO NOT modify, remove, or refactor any existing functionality unless explicitly requested by the user.**

This rule is **extremely important** and must be followed at all times during development.

- No assumptions.
- No optimizations.
- No cleanups.
- No deletions.

Only implement changes that are **clearly and directly requested** by the user.  
Any deviation from this rule may result in breaking expected behavior or violating business requirements.

> üîí Treat all existing code as intentional and required unless the user says otherwise.

---

## üß© MULTI-REQUEST & COMPLEX TASK STRATEGY

**When the user provides more than one request, the system must reason and execute step-by-step.**

- Break down multiple requests into logical, sequential steps
- Ensure each step is fully understood before execution
- Maintain clarity and traceability throughout the process

**For complex or layered tasks, sub-agents must be activated to analyze in parallel and converge on the optimal solution.**

- Use distributed reasoning across specialized sub-agents
- Integrate findings to produce the most effective and context-aware result
- Prioritize precision, scalability, and user intent alignment

> üß† Structured thinking and parallel analysis are required to handle multi-dimensional tasks with excellence.

---

## üó£Ô∏è RESPONSE LANGUAGE RULE

**All responses must be written in Korean.**

- Do not use English (except for code or proper nouns)
- All explanations, messages, and guidance must be in Korean
- Do not switch languages unless explicitly requested by the user

> üá∞üá∑ The user communicates in Korean by default. All interactions must respect this preference.

---

## üé≠ PERSONA & CONTEXT ENGINEERING RULE

**When requested by the user, assign a persona and generate output optimized for context engineering.**

- Persona must reflect the user's intent and tone
- Output should be context-aware, high-quality, and tailored to the scenario
- Maintain consistency with the assigned persona throughout the task

> üß† The system must produce top-tier results that align with the user's contextual goals and creative direction.

---

## üé® DESIGN CONSISTENCY RULE

**All design work must strictly follow the existing design tone and style already implemented.**

- Do not introduce new design directions unless explicitly requested
- Maintain visual, structural, and thematic consistency
- Respect the original design language and user expectations

> üß© Design integrity is critical. Consistency builds trust and coherence.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è ERROR HANDLING RULE

**When correcting errors, think thoroughly before applying any fix.**

- Analyze root causes carefully
- Avoid quick patches or assumptions
- Ensure the fix aligns with the broader system logic and user intent

> üß™ Every correction must be deliberate, thoughtful, and context-aware.

---

## üß† ULTRA-THINK MODE & SUB-AGENT STRATEGY

**For complex tasks, activate Ultra-Think Mode and divide the task into manageable subtasks using sub-agents.**

- Break down the problem into logical stages
- Assign sub-agents to handle each stage with clarity and precision
- Integrate results step-by-step to ensure coherence and completeness

> üöÄ Ultra-Think Mode ensures deep reasoning and structured execution for high-stakes or multi-layered tasks.

## üìÑ SPEC vs IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY RULE

**Even if the current implementation differs from the MD specification, DO NOT modify or delete the implemented functionality.**

- The MD file is a large, high-level planning document and cannot be updated in real time
- Treat the MD file as an initial blueprint, not a live source of truth
- The actual implemented features take precedence over written specs
- Never change or remove existing behavior just because it seems inconsistent with the MD file

> üõ°Ô∏è Protect implemented features. The MD file may lag behind development and should not override working code.

## Architecture

### Frontend Structure
- **Static HTML Pages**: Individual HTML files for each major section (index.html, events.html, notice.html, etc.)
- **CSS Organization**: 
  - `common.css` - Shared styles across all pages
  - Individual page CSS files (e.g., `events.css`, `notice.css`)
  - Modular CSS in `/css` directory (base.css, components.css, layout.css, etc.)
- **JavaScript Structure**:
  - ES6 modules in `/js/modules/` (sidebar.js, header.js, preload.js)
  - Main entry point: `js/main.js`
  - Page-specific scripts (e.g., `events.js`, `notice.js`)

### Key Design Patterns
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Collapsible categories with Font Awesome icons
- **User Profile System**: Points, badges, and rankings
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with hamburger menu
- **Glass Morphism Effects**: Modern UI with blur effects and gradients

## Development Commands

Since this is a static site project without package.json:
- **Run locally**: Use a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or VS Code Live Server)
- **CSS changes**: Directly edit CSS files, version query strings on link tags for cache busting
- **JS changes**: Update individual JS files, ensure module imports are correct
- **Test pages**: Use test-*.html files for component testing (test-attendance.html, test-navigation.html, test-simple.html)
- **Debug pages**: Use debug-*.html files for debugging specific features

## Design System Reference

The project follows a comprehensive design system documented in `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`:

### Core Design Tokens
- **Primary Colors**: #0066FF (primary), #0099FF (bright), #00CCFF (sky)
- **Spacing**: 8px grid system (space-1: 8px, space-2: 16px, etc.)
- **Typography**: Pretendard font family with defined scale
- **Border Radius**: XS (4px) to Full (9999px)
- **Animations**: Standardized durations (200ms, 300ms, 500ms)

### Component Standards
- **Buttons**: Primary (gradient), Secondary (outline), Text, Icon variants
- **Cards**: Glass effect with 16px border radius, hover animations
- **Forms**: 36px height inputs, 6px border radius, focus states
- **Tables**: Compact data tables with hover states

## PRD and Business Context

The platform serves real estate sales professionals with:
1. **Community Features**: Forums, Q&A, humor sections
2. **Professional Resources**: Market research, proposals, educational materials
3. **Career Services**: Job listings, headhunting system
4. **Gamification**: Points system, badges (28 types), mini-games
5. **AI Features**: Automated report generation

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Sidebar State**: Managed via localStorage for persistence
2. **User Authentication**: Mock data in current implementation (see js/mockUsers.js)
3. **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile (<640px), Tablet (640-1024px), Desktop (>1024px)
4. **Animation Performance**: Use CSS transforms over position changes
5. **Color Modes**: CSS variables support dark/light theme switching
6. **Korean Language**: All UI text should be in Korean for production
7. **Module System**: ES6 modules used throughout (main entry: js/main.js)
8. **Page-specific Scripts**: Each HTML page may have corresponding JS file (e.g., events.html ‚Üí events.js)

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Page
1. Create new HTML file (e.g., `newpage.html`)
2. Create corresponding CSS file (e.g., `newpage.css`)
3. Create corresponding JS file in root or js/ directory
4. Include common.css and page-specific CSS
5. Add data-page attribute to body tag for JS initialization
6. Update sidebar navigation if needed

### Working with Forms and Data
- Mock user data available in `js/mockUsers.js`
- Form data typically handled with localStorage for persistence
- Use Font Awesome icons for UI elements (already included)

### Testing and Debugging
- Use browser DevTools for debugging
- Check localStorage for persistent data issues
- Test responsive design at key breakpoints
- Verify Korean text rendering properly

## MCP Servers

The project includes several MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers in `/mcp-servers/`:
- Task management
- File editing utilities
- Image generation
- Browser automation

These are development tools and not part of the main application.
